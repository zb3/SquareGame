#SquareGame

The goal of this game is really simple - be the first to complete a row whose sum is a perfect square!
How? Tap on an empty square to place your digit there. (Digit is calculated like this: turn_number%no_of_digits+1)

**Note** If you're playing on a 3x3 board, don't start first - second player can always force a win on 3x3 board.
First player puts digit 1, then second 2, then again first 3,
